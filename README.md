## Lesson Objectives

* Train a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for language modeling, demonstrating an understanding of how deep learning architectures process sequential data complexities that traditional machine learning models cannot handle.

* Fine-tune a pre-trained **BERT model** to perform downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER), utilizing the model's bidirectional attention mechanism to derive deep contextual meaning from text.

* Utilize a pre-trained GPT model for text generation, distinguishing its unidirectional transformer architecture from BERT to effectively apply it in generative applications.
